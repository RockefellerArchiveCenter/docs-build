This is the central platform for the documentation of the Rockefeller Archive Center. It includes policies, guides, and technical documentation from all function areas of our organization. Each set of documentation is hosted in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter), and is available in Markdown. This is a static site built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
